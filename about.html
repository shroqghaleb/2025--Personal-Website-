            <p class="about-p"> When I have free time, I love to travel and explore new places.
                 Whether it’s a quick weekend getaway or a longer adventure,
                  I enjoy experiencing different cultures, trying new foods, and 
                  discovering hidden gems. Traveling gives me a fresh perspective, 
                  helps me recharge, and fuels my creativity. There's nothing quite like 
                  the excitement of visiting 
                somewhere new and making unforgettable memories along the way.

                <p class="about-p"> I love to get creative in the kitchen. 
                    Cooking is one of my favorite ways to unwind and experiment 
                    with new recipes. I enjoy trying out different cuisines,
                     from comforting home-cooked meals to more adventurous dishes.
                      There’s something so satisfying about creating a meal from 
                      scratch, and it’s even better when I get to share it with 
                      friends or family. It’s a perfect way for me to relax and 
                      express my creativity outside of work.

            <p class="about-p"> I like to focus on my fitness and wellness.
                 Whether it’s hitting the gym for a good workout, 
                 going for a run, or practicing yoga, staying active is important 
                 to me. It helps me clear my mind, boosts my energy, and keeps me 
                 feeling strong both physically and mentally. I also enjoy spending
                  time outdoors, whether it's hiking in nature or just getting some 
                  fresh air. Taking care of my body is a big part of maintaining a
                  healthy work-life balance.
